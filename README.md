Grade: 19 out of 20

**Project Description:** <br>
This project required the creation of a fictitious online shop (we created ISports), to which we should develop a MySQL database with an Entity Relationship Diagram, a SQL script to recreate the database and the existing data on it, another SQL script with some queries, and a Pentaho file for the ETL stage (Extract, transform, load). <br>
The fictitious online sports shop we worked around is called ISports. The company exists since 2018 and it is dedicated to selling all sorts of sport and sport related products, from different international brands, working as a retailer which resells products obtained directly from those brands. With this said, ISports’ focus is on various sporting equipment, appropriate clothing and other important supplies. <br>
This project’s report has a more detailed description of the company and a figure with the Entity Relationship Diagram. Furthermore, all the important files for the project are in this GitHub repository: two SQL files, a Pentaho file (.ktr), and an Excel sheet with customer data (necessary for the data integration performed in Pentaho).
